# Barter Bud 2019
- Bartering is a tradition as old as time itself. In this modern age, we have lost touch with this basic root of human civilization.
Barter Bud allows users to create a  SECURE profile where they could upload pictures of items or offering services that
They would like to trade and could interact and make offers with other users for trading said items or services WITHOUT using money.

## Description
- Barter bud helps the community
Barter Bud helps all the community with decluttering homes, offices, yards to make a better aesthetic backgrounds to have a peaceful mind. 
It is so important for our environment to Reduce landfills,  with Reuse and Recycle Items as much as possible.
Recycling saves energy, it also reduces greenhouse gas emissions.
The community feels stronger connections since they interact and helping each other.

## Conflict/Resolution
- Initially we used both sequelize and built an ORM to handle routing. We found out midway through that these were not compatible and hand to re-write the program using only sequelize
- MySQL won’t store photo files and Heroku charges money if too many files are uploaded. Given that this is a school project, we didn’t feel like shelling out cash to complete this but having photos of the items displayed is critical to the user experience. To remedy this, we added Cloudinary

## Eye to Future
- Eventually, we need to develop a chat window to display when a user requests a trade. As a part of our MVP, there is only a confirm button for the trades once an offer has been made. It would be nice to have more user interaction so that they may ask questions about the item and eventually set a meet up place
- If this app were to expand, a larger database would be needed to store files.
